/**
 * Shared shell-string builders for background jobs that run a command on a REMOTE shell
 * (host_exec / host_script over SSH, pod_script via kubectl-exec). The transport differs per
 * tool, but the "run as a killable session + reap it on job_stop" shell logic is identical and
 * quoting-sensitive, so it lives here once (and is covered by an e2e remote-reap smoke).
 *
 * Why a SESSION (setsid), not just a process group: GNU `timeout` puts its child in its OWN
 * process group, so a single `kill -<pgid>` of the launcher's group misses timeout's subtree.
 * setsid starts a new session whose id every descendant inherits (across timeout's sub-group),
 * so `pkill -s <sid>` reaps them all.
 *
 * Why NOT `setsid -w`: the `-w`/`--wait` flag only exists in util-linux >= 2.24 (2013). CentOS 7 /
 * RHEL 7 ship util-linux 2.23.2, and busybox `setsid` has no `-w` either, so `setsid -w` aborts
 * with "setsid: invalid option -- 'w'" and the command never runs. We get the same "wait + real
 * exit status" behavior portably by running setsid as a NON process-group-leader child (see
 * {@link wrapBackgroundSession}): when its caller isn't a process-group leader, setsid exec's the
 * program in place (no fork), so the launching shell's `wait` observes the real exit status on any
 * setsid version. The session is still created, so `pkill -s <sid>` reaping is unchanged.

/**
 * Wrap `innerCmd` so it runs as its own session leader (setsid), records the session id to
 * `pgidFile`, and removes the pidfile on normal exit. Returns ONE remote-shell command string.
 * `echo $$` consumes no stdin, so a piped script body flows through to `innerCmd` unchanged.
 *
 * The wrapper is `setsid sh -c '<launch>'; exit $?` (NOT `setsid -w`): the trailing `exit $?` is a
 * second command, so the launching shell can't exec-optimize the single `setsid` invocation and
 * must run it as a forked CHILD. That child is never a process-group leader, so setsid exec's
 * `sh -c '<launch>'` in place (no fork) on EVERY setsid version — incl. CentOS 7 / RHEL 7's
 * util-linux 2.23.2 and busybox, neither of which support `setsid -w`. Because there's no fork,
 * the launching shell `wait`s for the real command and `exit $?` propagates its true exit status.
 * It runs synchronously (no `&`), so a script body piped on stdin still reaches `innerCmd` (an `&`
 * async list would have its stdin redirected to /dev/null when job control is off).
 *
 * The inner `sh -c` records its own pid via `echo $$`; setsid has already made that pid the new
 * session id, so `pkill -s <sid>` still reaps the whole tree (incl. timeout's own process group).
 *
 * LOAD-BEARING CONTRACT — two assumptions this correctness depends on:
 *   1. The launching shell must NOT exec-optimize a multi-command sequence. POSIX shells
 *      (bash/dash/ash/busybox sh) run `<cmd>; exit $?` as a forked child, which is exactly what
 *      keeps setsid a non-leader so it exec's in place. A shell that tail-call-optimized the
 *      sequence would let setsid inherit leader status, fork internally, and — with no `-w` —
 *      the parent would exit 0 immediately, silently dropping the real exit code.
 *   2. Do NOT "simplify" this to `exec setsid …`. `exec` makes setsid inherit the launching
 *      shell's process-group-leader status, which triggers the same internal fork + lost exit
 *      code regression. The forked-child path (no `exec`) is required, not incidental.
