 * The XML shape mirrors Claude Code's LocalShellTask notification (Task.ts /
 * LocalShellTask.tsx) so the model sees a familiar, structured signal:
 *
 *   <task_notification>
 *   <task_id>b1a2c3…</task_id>
 *   <output_file>/…/agent/tasks/b1a2c3.output</output_file>   (bash only)
 *   <status>completed</status>
 *   <summary>Background command "kubectl logs …" completed (exit 0)</summary>
 *   </task_notification>
 *
 * For sub-agents the `output_file` line is omitted (the result is a summary capsule;
 * drill-in is via the Portal transcript, not a flat file).
