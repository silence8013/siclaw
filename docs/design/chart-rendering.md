# Chart Rendering

> **Purpose**: Document the contract between any MCP tool that produces charts and
> the Portal chat frontend that renders them. Read this before writing a new chart
> tool or adding a new chart type.

## How It Works

The frontend recognises chart output through a single convention: a fenced
Markdown code block with the language tag `chart`.

```
```chart
{"type":"pie","data":{"slices":[{"label":"kube-system","value":1005}]}}
```
```

Any MCP tool that produces this block will have its output rendered as an
interactive SVG chart inside the chat bubble. No frontend changes are required
as long as the fence tag is `chart` and the JSON matches the `ChartSpec` schema
(see [§ ChartSpec schema](#chartspec-schema) below).

---

## The Rendering Pipeline

```
MCP tool
  └── emits  ```chart\n{JSON}\n```  in its text response

Markdown.tsx  (portal-web/src/components/chat/Markdown.tsx)
  └── react-markdown encounters a <pre><code className="language-chart">
        └── hasLanguageClass(className, "chart") → true
              └── <ChartFence text={rawJson} />

ChartFence  (inside Markdown.tsx)
  └── useMemo → tryParseChartSpec(text)
        ├── JSON incomplete (still streaming)  → <ChartLoading /> spinner
        ├── JSON complete, parse fails         → <ChartParseError />
        └── JSON complete, parse succeeds      → <ChartRenderer spec={spec} />

ChartRenderer  (portal-web/src/components/chat/ChartRenderer.tsx)
  └── wrapped in React.memo — skips re-render when spec is unchanged
        ├── spec.type === "pie"  → renderPie
        ├── spec.type === "bar"  → renderBar
        └── spec.type === "line" → renderLine
```

### Why the spinner, not a partial chart?

The `chart` fence contains a single JSON object. Until the LLM finishes
streaming that object the JSON is syntactically incomplete (`tryParseChartSpec`
returns `null`). There is no meaningful partial state to display, so the
frontend shows a spinner until the spec is fully parseable.

### Why React.memo?

The chat bubble re-renders on every streamed token. Without memoization the SVG
subtree (hundreds of nodes) would be rebuilt on every token the LLM emits
*after* the chart fence has closed — producing visible flicker for as long as
the model keeps streaming prose. `React.memo` with a `JSON.stringify`-based
comparator ensures the chart paints exactly once after the spec arrives and is
then frozen until the spec actually changes.

## ChartSpec Schema

`tryParseChartSpec` (in `portal-web/src/components/chat/chart-utils.ts`)
validates and normalises the JSON. The accepted shapes are:

### Pie chart

```json
{
  "type": "pie",
  "data": {
    "slices": [
      { "label": "kube-system", "value": 1005 },
      { "label": "monitoring",  "value": 383  }
    ]
  },
  "title": "Pod distribution",
  "width": 760,
  "height": 480
}
```

### Bar chart

```json
{
  "type": "bar",
  "data": {
    "categories": ["kube-system", "monitoring"],
    "series": [
      { "name": "Pods", "values": [1005, 383] }
    ]
  },
  "title": "Top namespaces",
  "y_label": "Pod count"
}
```

### Line chart

```json
{
  "type": "line",
  "data": {
    "series": [
      {
        "name": "total pods",
        "points": [
          { "x": 1716000000, "y": 1840 },
          { "x": 1716003600, "y": 1856 }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "title": "Pod count over time",
  "x_label": "Time",
  "y_label": "Pods"
}
```

**Common optional fields** (all chart types): `title`, `width`, `height`,
`x_label`, `y_label`.

**Line chart x values**: pass epoch seconds as a `number` for time-series data;
the renderer formats them as `HH:MM`. Pass a `string` for categorical x-axes.

## Writing a New MCP Chart Tool

The only contract the frontend enforces is the fence tag and the JSON shape.
To have your tool's output rendered as a chart:

1. Serialise your data as one of the `ChartSpec` shapes above.
2. Wrap it in a `chart` fence and include it verbatim in your tool's text
   response:

```ts
const markdownEmbed = "```chart\n" + JSON.stringify(spec) + "\n```"
```

3. Instruct the LLM to paste the block as-is (do not re-escape or re-wrap it).

The frontend needs no changes. All three chart types — and any future type added
to `ChartSpec` — share the same fence tag and the same anti-flicker path.

---

## Adding a New Chart Type

If pie/bar/line do not cover your use case, add a new type to the union:

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `portal-web/src/components/chat/chart-utils.ts` | Extend `ChartSpec` union; add validation in `tryParseChartSpec`; add any new layout helpers |
| `portal-web/src/components/chat/ChartRenderer.tsx` | Add a `renderXxx` function; add a branch in the `useMemo` inside `ChartRenderer` |
| `mcp/create-chart/src/handler.ts` | Add the new type to the input schema enum and `validate()` |
| `mcp/create-chart/src/types.ts` | Extend `RenderChartArgs` |

**No changes needed in `Markdown.tsx`** — the `hasLanguageClass(className, "chart")`
gate and the `ChartFence` memoization cover every type in the `ChartSpec` union
automatically.

---

## What the Frontend Does NOT Support

- **Other fence tags**: ` ```mermaid `, ` ```echarts `, etc. fall through to the
  generic `<pre>` renderer (raw text). Add a separate handler in
  `MARKDOWN_COMPONENTS` in `Markdown.tsx` if you need them.
- **Inline `<img>` tags or `data:` URIs as chart output**: these bypass
  `ChartRenderer` entirely and receive no interactivity (hover tooltip,
  copy/download toolbar, log-scale toggle).
- **Streaming partial charts**: the spinner is the only streaming state; there
  is no incremental render of partially-arrived data.
